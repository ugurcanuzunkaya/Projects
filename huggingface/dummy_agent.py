    get_weather: Get the current weather in a given location

    The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
    Specifically, this json should have an `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and an `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

    The only values that should be in the "action" field are:
    get_weather: Get the current weather in a given location, args: {"location": {"type": "string"}}
    example use :

    {{
    "action": "get_weather",
    "action_input": {"location": "New York"}
    }}


    ALWAYS use the following format:

    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about one action to take. Only one action at a time in this format:
    Action:

    $JSON_BLOB (inside markdown cell)

    Observation: the result of the action. This Observation is unique, complete, and the source of truth.
    ... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed. The $JSON_BLOB must be formatted as markdown and only use a SINGLE action at a time.)

    You must always end your output with the following format:

    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

    Now begin! Reminder to ALWAYS use the exact characters `Final Answer:` when you provide a definitive answer. """
