# Introduction to Python for Developers Course - Datacamp

##  What is Python?

- Open source programming language
- Packages to use other's code to avoid reinventing the wheel
- Syntax resembles English
- Use cases;
  - Task automation
  - Web apps
  - Artificial intelligence (AI)
    - Web scraping
    - Content generation / summarization
    - Image recognition
- Easier to code and develop
- Python is a high-level language
- Python is slow compared to C, C++, Java, etc.

##  How to run Python Code

- Code comments
  - Single line comments: `#`
  - Multi-line comments: `'''` or `"""`
  - It doesn't affect the code execution. It's for the developer to understand the code.

- Calculations
  - Python can be used as a calculator.
  - Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
  - Order of operations: `()`, `**`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `+`, `-`
  - Division: `/` returns a float, `//` returns an integer
  - Modulus: `%` returns the remainder of the division
  - Exponentiation: `**` returns the power of a number

- print() function
  - `print()` function is used to display the output.
  - It can take multiple arguments.
  - It can take keyword arguments.
  - It can take a separator argument.
  - It can take an end argument.

## Review

- You learned about the basics of running Python code, including the use of the DataCamp interface for executing Python scripts. You explored how to write and run Python code in both the IPython Shell and script files (.py), understanding the importance of comments for code clarity. Additionally, you discovered how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Python, using it as a powerful calculator. Key points include:

- The IPython Shell allows for immediate execution and output display of Python code.
- Python script files, saved with a .py extension, can be executed to perform tasks, with the print() function used to display outputs.
- Comments, starting with a #, help document the code without affecting its execution.
- Basic arithmetic operations in Python include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Advanced operations like exponentiation (**) and modulo (%) allow for more complex calculations.
- For example, to perform and print calculations, you used code like this:

```python
# Add 19 and 17
print(19 + 17)

# Calculate nine squared
print(9 ** 2)
```

- This lesson laid the foundation for using Python for various calculations, an essential skill for any programming task.
