    "### What is MLOps?\n",
    "- A paradigm to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production.\n",
    "- A set of best-practice workflows with focus on continuous development of such models\n",
    "- Inspired by DevOps:\n",
    "    - Machine learning models are developed and tested in isolated experimental systems, and then deployed to production systems.\n",
    "    - When in production, continuous monitoring, their accuracy is constantly checked, and improvements through retraining may be triggered.\n",
    "- Data scientists, data engineers, and IT teams can work on deployed models synchronously and ensure model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing MLOps on Kubernetes\n",
    "- The MLOps paradigm maps very well to Kubernetes:\n",
    "    - Isolated experimental systems: can be realized via Pods and Kubernetes Storage.\n",
    "    - Monitoring production ML models: enabled via lifecycle of Pods (and deployed image versions)\n",
    "    - Synchronous work on model accuracy: built in from the very beginning by Kubernetes architecture.\n",
    "- Several frameworks for MLOps exist; the two best-known open-source solutions are\n",
    "    - mlflow\n",
    "    - kubeflow\n",

    "### Kubeflow - An Overview\n",
    "- Kubeflow allows simple deployments of ML workflows specifically on Kubernetes.\n",
    "- Covers each step of the ML model lifecycle\n",
    "- Data gathering, data wrangling, model training, testing, and deployment\n",
    "- Consists of several components which cover these steps, working independently\n",
    "- All these components work independently of each other. This enables maximum flexibility and scalability.\n",
    "- Python can be used to develop and deploy ML models via an API\n",
    "    - no need to use kubectl\n",
