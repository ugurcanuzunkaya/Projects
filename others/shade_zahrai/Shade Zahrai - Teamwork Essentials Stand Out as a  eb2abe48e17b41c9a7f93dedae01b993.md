Engage fully with your teammates

- **E**levate. Trait Affective Presence. We can elevate our vibe when we recognize. Maintain healthy levels of courage and enthusiasm. Use encouraging language. Call out small wins and strengths (Praise)

Manage expectations and foster trust

If expectations within your team aren’t managed, you’ll likely lose their trust. There is two type of trust: Integrity-based (I trust your motives) and Competency-based (I trust your skills).

- Maintaining your trustworthiness.
  - Commit and Deliver: If you commit to it, do it. If you know in advance you won’t able to do something, manage expectations early. Seek support if needed.
  - Put it in Writing. Document Accountabilities and Email Expectations. What specifically needs to be done? When is the deadline? Who is responsible?
  - Set boundaries. Don’t accept if you can’t to do it in time. There is two-step approach to respond.
    - Positive response: Sure, I can take that on.
    - Request solution. Seek help to reprioritize what’s on your list to work on what’s urgent? Managers don’t know or remembers %60 of the work you do. So it is plausible that the rest of the team won’t know the extent of your workload either. If they see your list, they can delegate or offer their help.

Foster psychological safety

To encourage psychological safety within your team with these five practices.

- Admit errors: Show others to it is okay to make errors. Demonstrate vulnerability and directness.
- Investigate mistakes: It fosters the growth mindset. People feel more involved, accountable and willing to grow.
- Throw a concern party: Encourage your team to take 10 minutes to individually write down their greatest anxieties about performance, business uncertainty, anything. Then give them 2 minutes ranking their anxieties in order of severity. Share their list to invite opportunities for team support, empathy and solutions.
- Ask for help: Creates permission for others to do the same. Fostering greater collaboration, which leads to better use of talent.
- Validate through expressions: Be present and demonstrate engagement. Nod, smile, validate.

It is not the only managers job to do it. Everyone need to step in and help to build it.

Capitalize on collaboration for team building

Collaboration is at the heart of teamwork. Three powerful practices to help you enhance your team’s collaboration.

- Clarify content: It’s vital to continually clarify the team’s purpose in the context of the big picture.
  - What’s our organization’s purpose?
  - How does our department contribute?
  - How does our team contribute?
  - How does this project contribute?
- Consultation
  - Ideas aren’t personal: Make a pact that whatever is contributed by an individual belongs to the group. I hate you ❌. I disagree with the idea because of the … ✔
  - Considerate it candor: The purpose is to seek the truth.
  - United agreement: It’s better to preserve team unity by supporting group’s decision. Because unity is what leads a team to continually improve and correct their decisions.  It doesn’t mean the group proceed with any dangerous decision that lacks integrity. This isn’t about creating group think.
- Pay it forward: Generalized reciprocity. It’s the virtuous cycle of cooperation.

Confidently navigate conflict and offer feedback

Three practical ways to navigate high-friction situations to minimize misunderstanding and protect integrity of your relationships.

- Communicate assertively
- Maintain composure
- Make it about you
- Meet face to face: Try to solve conflicts and disagreements face-to-face where possible.
- Share your interest
- Stay curious: To avoid a defensive reaction, be curious and use one of these four phrases. That’s interesting, Can you tell me more about that?, What makes your say that?, What made you do that?, What made you think that?. They can help to deescalate high-pressure situations and are a valuable addition to your conflict management toolkit.
- Offer feedback: Five-step brain-friendly approach to give effective feedback.
  - Prime with “yes”: Ask a short question to prime the receiver.
  - Give authentic praise: Validate something about the person or their approach.
  - Provide a datapoint: Be specific and factual.
  - Share the impact (Impact statement): Share how the data point impacted you or the team to provide a sense of meaning and remind them of how their work matters. Check in and end with a collaborative question.

Play to your strengths

According to Marcus Buckingham (Go Put Your Strength To Work, 2007), a strength is not something that you’re simply good at. A real strength is an activity that strengthens you internally, that you look forward to doing. It leaves you feeling energized rather than depleted.

A Gallup study found that focusing on strengths can lead to an almost %20 increase in performance and %73 lower attrition.

When you can contribute your strengths, everyone wins. It’s also important to encourage others to contribute their strengths to the team too. The best teams know each other’s strengths, how to get the best out of one another, and how to energize each other so that everyone performs harmoniously. This is how you can become a team culture creator.

Hone your strategy skills

High performing teams need team members who are able to think strategically in order to be proactive, adaptable, and innovate and this helps you stand out as a key contributor. Five surprisingly easy ways to reconfigure your thinking to be more strategic.

- Ask strategic questions
- Ask why: Develop a habit of often asking yourself why am I doing this? This reminds you of the big picture and aligns your decision making with the team and company goals.
- Consider alternatives using inversion: By considering weaknesses in advance you’re better able to prepare for and mitigate them before they arise.
- Identify gaps: Vision, goal, people, task.
- Conduct a post-mortem: In the world of management, a post-mortem is a post-implementation review. Once you finished a project reflect on what went well and what didn’t.

Develop your solution-orientation

Solution orientation is a critical skill that encourages everyone in the team to work together towards finding solutions rather than just pointing out problems. Here are three tips to cultivate your solution orientation.

- Reframe language: Involves changing the way that we talk about a problem to make it more amenable to solutions.
  - “We are in financial trouble and don’t know what to do? —> We see this as an opportunity to reevaluate our business model and find new ways to increase revenue and cut costs improving our financial health in the long run”.
  - This way, you’re more open-minded to creative solutions and can emerge from the situation even stronger than before.
  - This way you’re more proactive, rather than feeling defeated. These simple shifts in language can have a profound effect on how we approach the problem, encouraging us to think more positively and creatively.
- Collective curiosity: A true solution orientation requires you to ask curious questions to the root of the issue and to think more creatively. How questions.
- Offer solutions: Cognitive flexibility.

By incorporating solution orientation into day-to-day thinking you can become an invaluable asset to any team.  Not only will you be able to identify problems and offer solutions, but you’ll also encourage the team to work together towards finding the best solution.
