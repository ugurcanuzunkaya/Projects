    "### Summary: Downloading Binary Data with the Requests Library\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, we learned how to use the requests library to download binary data, such as images or zip files, from the web. Previously, we worked with text data using the text and json methods of the requests library. Now, we focus on handling non-text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Download Binary Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the URL of the Binary File**:\n",
    "   - For example, to download an image from a Wikipedia page, right-click the image and select \"Open image in new tab.\" Copy the URL from the address bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up the URL and Import the Requests Library**:\n",
    "   - Example URL for an image:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     url = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Golden_Gate_Bridge%2C_SF_%28cropped%29.jpg/800px-Golden_Gate_Bridge%2C_SF_%28cropped%29.jpg\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Import the requests library:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import requests\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Make a Request to Get the Binary Data**:\n",
    "   - Use the `requests.get` method to fetch the data:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check the Response**:\n",
    "   - Ensure the request was successful (HTTP status code 200):\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if response.status_code == 200:\n",
    "         # Proceed to save the binary data\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Write the Binary Data to a File**:\n",
    "   - Open a file in write binary mode (`wb`) and write the response content:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     with open(\"downloaded_image.jpg\", \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "         file.write(response.content)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Verify the Downloaded File**:\n",
    "   - Refresh your project directory to see the downloaded file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Code Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "# URL of the image to be downloaded\n",
    "url = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Golden_Gate_Bridge%2C_SF_%28cropped%29.jpg/800px-Golden_Gate_Bridge%2C_SF_%28cropped%29.jpg\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Send a GET request to the URL\n",
    "response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if the request was successful\n",
    "if response.status_code == 200:\n",
    "    # Open a file in write binary mode and save the content\n",
    "    with open(\"downloaded_image.jpg\", \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "        file.write(response.content)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Image downloaded successfully.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- **Binary Mode (`wb`)**: When working with binary files, such as images, ensure you open the file in write binary mode (`wb`).\n",
    "- **Response Content**: Use `response.content` to access the raw binary data from the response.\n",
    "- **File Extension**: Ensure the file extension matches the type of file you are downloading (e.g., `.jpg` for images, `.zip` for zip files).\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can download and save any binary file from the web using Python and the requests library.\n",

    "### Summary: Constructing a Website with Streamlit and Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, the instructor demonstrates how to construct a simple website using Streamlit and the requests library to fetch and display an astronomy picture along with its title and explanation from an API. The entire process is done in about 27 lines of code. Below are the steps and the code explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Construct the Website:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries**:\n",
    "   - Import the required libraries: `requests` for fetching data and `streamlit` for building the web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up API Key and URL**:\n",
    "   - Prepare the API key and the URL to the astronomy picture of the day API. Use an f-string to embed the API key within the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fetch Data from API**:\n",
    "   - Use the `requests.get` method to send a GET request to the API URL and gather the data in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extract Data from JSON**:\n",
    "   - Extract the title, URL of the image, and explanation from the JSON response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Download the Image**:\n",
    "   - Create a file path for the downloaded image.\n",
    "   - Send a GET request to the image URL to fetch the image data.\n",
    "   - Open a new file in write-binary mode (`wb`) and write the image data to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Build the Streamlit Web Page**:\n",
    "   - Use Streamlit's `st.title` to display the title.\n",
    "   - Use `st.image` to display the downloaded image.\n",
    "   - Use `st.write` to display the explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Code Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "\n",
    "# API key and URL setup\n",
    "api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n",
    "url = f\"https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key={api_key}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch data from the API\n",
    "response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "data = response.json()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extract data from JSON response\n",
    "title = data['title']\n",
    "image_url = data['url']\n",
    "explanation = data['explanation']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Download the image\n",
    "image_path = \"image.png\"\n",
    "image_response = requests.get(image_url)\n",
    "with open(image_path, \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(image_response.content)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build the Streamlit web page\n",
    "st.title(title)\n",
    "st.image(image_path)\n",
    "st.write(explanation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries**:\n",
    "   - `requests`: To handle HTTP requests.\n",
    "   - `streamlit`: To create and display the web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **API Key and URL**:\n",
    "   - The API key is stored in a variable `api_key`.\n",
    "   - The URL to the NASA API is created using an f-string for embedding the API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fetching Data**:\n",
    "   - A GET request is sent to the API URL using `requests.get(url)`.\n",
    "   - The response is converted to JSON format using `response.json()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extracting Data**:\n",
    "   - The `title`, `url` (for the image), and `explanation` fields are extracted from the JSON response and stored in separate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Downloading the Image**:\n",
    "   - The image URL is used to send another GET request to fetch the image data.\n",
    "   - The image data is written to a file named `image.png` in binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Building the Web Page**:\n",
    "   - `st.title(title)` displays the title of the image.\n",
    "   - `st.image(image_path)` displays the downloaded image.\n",
    "   - `st.write(explanation)` displays the explanation of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process effectively uses the requests library to fetch and process data from an API and Streamlit to build and display a web page with the fetched data.\n",
    "\n",
