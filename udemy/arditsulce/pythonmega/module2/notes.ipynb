    "### Final Notes:\n",
    "- Adding footers to each page ensures users can keep track of the pages they are working on.\n",
    "- Disabling automatic page breaks gives more control over the layout of the PDF document.\n",
    "- Using nested for loops allows for efficient handling of multiple topics and their respective pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can create a well-structured PDF document with multiple pages per topic and custom footers on each page, enhancing the usability of the document for note-taking and other purposes.\n",

    "### Exercise: Adding Horizontal Lines to PDF Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "The task for this exercise is to improve the existing PDF generation program by adding horizontal lines to each page of the document. The lines should be evenly spaced, with a suggested distance of 10 millimeters between them. The other elements of the document, such as the headers and footers, should remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Add Horizontal Lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up the Project**:\n",
    "   - Ensure you have the existing project set up with `main.py` and `topics.csv`.\n",
    "   - Ensure `pandas` and `FPDF` libraries are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Read CSV Data**:\n",
    "   - Import the necessary libraries and read the CSV file as done previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate PDF with Headers, Footers, and Horizontal Lines**:\n",
    "   - Create the PDF instance.\n",
    "   - Iterate through the DataFrame to add pages, headers, footers, and horizontal lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Notes:\n",
    "- Adjust the `y_start` and `line_height` values in the `add_horizontal_lines` function as needed to change the starting position and distance between lines.\n",
    "- Ensure the text color and font settings match your requirements.\n",
    "- Save and run the script to generate the updated PDF document with horizontal lines on each page.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can create a well-structured PDF document with headers, footers, and horizontal lines, enhancing the usability of the document for note-taking and other purposes.\n",
