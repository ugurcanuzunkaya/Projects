# PDF Generation Project

## Overview
This project generates a PDF file with multiple pages based on data from a CSV file. Each page contains a topic title and lined sections for writing notes. The generated PDF is formatted with specific fonts, line spacing, and includes page numbers.

## Key Libraries
- **FPDF**: Used for creating PDF files.
- **Pandas**: Used for reading data from a CSV file.

## Project Structure

├── main.py               # The main script to generate the PDF
├── topics.csv            # The CSV file containing topics and page numbers
├── README.md             # Readme file for the project
└── simple_demo.pdf       # The generated PDF file
```

## External File Structure
- **topics.csv**: This CSV file contains the topics and the number of pages for each topic. Example:
  ```
  Order,Topic,Pages
  1,Variables,2
  2,Lists,3
  ...
  ```

## Explanation of Key Functions and Methods
- **FPDF library**: Initializes and formats the PDF document.
- **Pandas library**: Reads and processes the CSV file.
- **Main script**:
  - Reads the CSV file into a DataFrame.
  - Iterates through each row of the DataFrame to add pages to the PDF with the topic title and lined sections.
  - Adds page numbers and handles additional pages if required.

## Final Output
The final output is a PDF file named `simple_demo.pdf`. Each topic from the CSV file is displayed on a new page, with lined sections for writing notes and page numbers at the bottom.
